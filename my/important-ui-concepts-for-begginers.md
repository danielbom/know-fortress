# Important UI concepts for begginers:

## Line Height

- Headings: font-size * 1.1 (or 1.2, 1.3)
- Body:     font-size * 1.3 (or 1.4, 1.5)

## Letter Spacing

- Heading:  -0.5% (or -1%, -2%)

## Text Alignment

- Don't mix center align heading with left align body

## Text Width

> Haing the right amount of characters on each line is key of the readability of your text.
> Indeed, our Premium UX research and large-scale e-commerce UX testing revels that _long lines of text are typically perceived by users as intimidating and overwhelming._
> _As result, users faced with overly long lines of text are more likely to **avoid reading the text**_
> Consequently, as readability drops _more users will fail to fully understand a product's or service's benefits, and thus decide that a particular product or service won't meet their needs._

- The optional line length for body text is 50-75 characters. (600px)

## Hierarchy

- Try use 2 font sizes and font weights and colors to change the hierarchy

## Spacing

> Sing the bottom heading and the body text has a closer relationship, they should also be positioned closer to each other.
